Am currently not employed and looking for work opportunities with some significant overlap with either of backend engineering, data engineering and distributed systems.

I most recently worked at [RoverX](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/roverx) for a couple of years as an early engineer on the backend team where we built a crypto exchange aggregator platform and an NFT analytics and alerts tool.

I am currently based out of Bangalore.

In the programming world, I am enthusiastic about FOSS and impressive communities though have never been an active contributor yet. My goal (over the next year) is to find some interesting repos where I can contribute and be more active.
