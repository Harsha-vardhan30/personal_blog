I am Harsha. Love math, programming, music and good food.

If you want to know what I'm up to these days head over [here](/now).

You can find out some non-technical things [here](/me).

You can find some of my opinions/notes (which are bound to change) [here](/random).

If you wish to talk to me, you can drop me a message on [twitter](https://twitter.com/cant_find_nick) or mail me at reverse("{{< rev_email >}}") at gmail.com.
