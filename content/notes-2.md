[Dream11](https://www.dream11.com/): One of the most original ideas for a startup in the Indian setting. (Cricket :heart: ) I tried it out during IPL last year (with the free credit and PhonePe linking) but found it tough to make money. Realized it is a zero-sum game, and one needs to have better strategies to make money. Quite fun, though, when competing with friends. (Also lead to a string of other startups in fantasy gaming)

[Repos energy](https://reposenergy.com/): Petrol pump on wheels felt like an innovative idea. Competing with oil tankers, I guess, but more transparent and ease of use. Can we see mobile petrol stations in places with low pump penetration in the future?

[Go-gaga](https://www.go-gaga-app.com/): Liked the idea of getting introduced by friends. But better adoption/trial rates by introducing on existing social platforms like Fb Dating. ([Source](https://yourstory.com/2019/09/facebook-incubated-gogaga-dating-app-matchmaking-singles))

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/): Great interfaces and features for building your own branded web market-place and standout opposing the get listed on Amazon as a seller. Web-commerce competing with Social Commerce. 

Social Commerce Chinese giant WeChat. Whatsapp already enables a lot of informal social commerce (Maybe more after the Jio deal). My friend told me his information got auto-filled when he was trying out JioMart after he just provided his mobile number. Any guesses how?

[Meesho](https://meesho.com/) : An FB backed startup. People recommend products on the site to their circle and earn commissions for products sold. (I thought of [Lularoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LuLaRoe) when I read about this)

Super Apps: All in One. WeChat, Grab, GoJek. (PhonePe thesedays?)

[Classplus](https://classplusapp.com/): Shopify for tutors and educational institutes ([Source](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/03/classplus-coaching-centers-teachers-online/))

[Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/), [Freshworks](https://www.freshworks.com/), [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/), [Zeta](https://www.zeta.tech/) and many more : SaaS startups from India. Fewer capital requirements than SaaS companies from other countries and have lower customer acquisition costs in B2B in comparison to B2C.

Enabling free SaaS and making value out of that has been Google And FB's golden strategy. (Read about Whatsapp's merger with FB at a high price and Whatsapp's founders deal that Whatsapp would never have ads) Google's AdSense

Spotify's story: At the forefront of enabling no-piracy music. High acquisition cost from music labels (Should follow something like Netlfix Originals?), Recent foray into Podcasts (some acquisitions recently so that podcasts can be self-made, higher margins). A great customer base for podcasts in the US already. (Audio too?, I was a tad surprised) I believe people would follow video-enabled podcasts more than audio-only podcasts.

An interesting [article](https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr) on culture at Netflix. A [link](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664) to the archived slides [PS: I didn't go through the slides myself, but with 18 million hits I thought it deserved to be shared lol]

HashiCorp Tao

[Substack](https://substack.com/): A platform where you can start your own blog/journal and gain subscribers and monetize it via subscribe and view model without ads. As a reader, you can subscribe to your favorite writers and get updates via email. One might feel going back to mails instead of some web feed as a negative. More like Medium + writer's monetizing channel - medium feeds.

If you want to catch up with the buzz on twitter about Clubhouse, [here](https://divinations.substack.com/p/inside-the-clubhouse) is a read. It's an audio calling app where you can join random group calls and talk. Based on the idea that people like to be spontaneous instead of scheduling things. Its future will depend on avoiding things like Zoom bombing, grouping people as communities(maybe not?), steering towards exciting conversations.

[Loco](https://getloconow.com/): Started as an app inspired by HQTrivia. I used it for some days during my college days to play KBC styled quiz with friends. These days they are into live game streaming kind of stuff.

[Dunzo](https://www.dunzo.com/): Get anything delivered

[Buffer](https://buffer.com/): Schedule your social media updates and keep track of reach, impact.

[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/): Imagine the extra efforts needed to write an API with rate-limits. And then consider additional efforts needed trying to write code to mitigate [DDOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) attacks, bots. Cloudflare helps in avoiding DDOS attacks and [CDN support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network).

Authentication and [IAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management) as service: [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) and [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) (On Google, I saw an Auth0 vs. Okta ad redirecting to Okta. Just crazy marketing. These days when I search for small business sites on Google, I consciously avoid clicking on the promoted ad link of the website to save the business some tiny cents :relaxed:)

[Drift](https://www.drift.com/): Conversations on site for queries/sales as a service

[Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/): Data Monitoring for National Security, Fraud prevention (surprised seeing the idea of this highly valued startup)

Read on the failure of [MoviePass](https://www.moviepass.com/): An unlimited monthly subscription service for 10 USD. Are you kidding? (*TODO: Add useful link to read*)

Change startup-centered news to non-valuation centric headlines?
