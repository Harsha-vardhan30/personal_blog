[Dream11](https://www.dream11.com/): One of the most original ideas for a startup in the Indian setting. (Cricket :heart: ) I tried it out during IPL last year (with the free credit and PhonePe linking) but found it tough to make money. Realized it is a zero-sum game, and one needs to have better strategies to make money. Quite fun, though, when competing with friends. (Also lead to a string of other startups in fantasy gaming)

[Repos energy](https://reposenergy.com/): Petrol pump on wheels felt like an innovative idea. Competing with oil tankers, I guess, but more transparent and ease of use. Can we see mobile petrol stations in places with low pump penetration in the future?

[Go-gaga](https://www.go-gaga-app.com/): Liked the idea of getting introduced by friends. But better adoption/trial rates by introducing on existing social platforms like Fb Dating. ([Source](https://yourstory.com/2019/09/facebook-incubated-gogaga-dating-app-matchmaking-singles))

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/): Great interfaces and features for building your own branded web market-place and standout opposing the get listed on Amazon as a seller. Web-commerce competing with Social Commerce. 

Social Commerce Chinese giant WeChat. Whatsapp already enables a lot of informal social commerce (Maybe more after the Jio deal). My friend told me his information got auto-filled when he was trying out JioMart after he just provided his mobile number. Any guesses how?

[Meesho](https://meesho.com/) : An FB backed startup. People recommend products on the site to their circle and earn commissions for products sold. (I thought of [Lularoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LuLaRoe) when I read about this)

Super Apps: All in One. WeChat, Grab, GoJek. (PhonePe thesedays?)

[Classplus](https://classplusapp.com/): Shopify for tutors and educational institutes ([Source](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/03/classplus-coaching-centers-teachers-online/))

[Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/), [Freshworks](https://www.freshworks.com/), [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/), [Zeta](https://www.zeta.tech/) and many more : SaaS startups from India. Fewer capital requirements than SaaS companies from other countries and have lower customer acquisition costs in B2B in comparison to B2C.

Enabling free SaaS and making value out of that has been Google And FB's golden strategy. (Read about Whatsapp's merger with FB at a high price and Whatsapp's founders deal that Whatsapp would never have ads) Google's AdSense

Spotify's story: At the forefront of enabling no-piracy music. High acquisition cost from music labels (Should follow something like Netlfix Originals?), Recent foray into Podcasts (some acquisitions recently so that podcasts can be self-made, higher margins). A great customer base for podcasts in the US already. (Audio too?, I was a tad surprised) I believe people would follow video-enabled podcasts more than audio-only podcasts.

An interesting [article](https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr) on culture at Netflix. A [link](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664) to the archived slides [PS: I didn't go through the slides myself, but with 18 million hits I thought it deserved to be shared lol]
