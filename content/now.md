I currently work at Samsung.

These days I mostly spend time reading articles/blogs on the web related to programming, startups, finance, and world history/politics.

In the programming world, I am enthusiastic about FOSS and impressive communities. I came across (Docker) containers, Kubernetes, and CNCF a while ago.  After knowing more about Kubernetes, my interest in Distributed Systems grew. I try to keep following the cloud community, but I find it tight keeping up to date when you donâ€™t work much in the same field.

When I'm home, I mostly surf web, watch a lot of movies/series on Netflix, Prime Video.
