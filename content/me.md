I listen to a lot of music. You can find my public youtube playlists [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHuPwbGr2A8uzM_WalXrgkQ/playlists).

I previously used to watch a lot of regional content across Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada. (I natively understand only Telugu and some Hindi, I use subtitles for the rest) 

I want to document the movies/series I have watched when I have time.

I bought a Casio at the end of 2019. I didnâ€™t use it much yet. I wish to learn to play it.

I used to watch a lot of cricket since childhood (as most Indians?). I play sometimes, but I don't know much about the intricate details of the game (where to pitch the ball, how difficult it is to hit a particular shot, Gully vs. Silly point, etc.). I used to follow cricbuzz a lot. (There were days when I was happy because Cricbuzz published my comments :blush:) 

I used to play table tennis, carroms, and (online) chess at my university with friends. (all of these, not so actively now)

I love playing board games, cards, and poker with friends.

I never played desktop games much. The only mobile game I played a lot is Subway Surfers lol.

I enjoy standup comedy. My first ever standup show was watching Atul Khatri perform in the university. After that, I came across East India Comedy (EIC), of which Atul was part of and watched their videos on Youtube (I still remember Ghanta awards). I used to be a big fan of EIC (And also EIC Outrage). I started following the Indian Standup scene on the web in 2017. Some of my favorites are EIC, Biswa, Kenny, (some) AIB, Abish (for Son Of Abish), Niveditha (from TLC Queens Of Comedy), Urooj (Comicstaan), Abhishek Upmanyu, Zakir, Rahul Subramanian, Aravind SA, Prashasti and so on. I personally liked Comicstaan a lot (also The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel series for its standup roots). I wish to watch more live comedy shows when I get back home.

I believe in the evolution of the Indian Hip Hop scene (similar to the rise of Indian Standup) made famous by the film *Gully Boy* into the mainstream. (I love the whole album too, you can catch me humming *Azadi* and *Jingostan*)
