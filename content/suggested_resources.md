- [Finshots](https://finshots.in/): Short and sweet articles once a day, cleanly explained in layman terms, market economics and India centered

- I learned about Kubernetes, mainly from *Kubernetes Up and Running* and *Managing Kubernetes* books, multiple youtube videos by *CNCF* and *Google Cloud Next*. *Kelsey Hightower* is dope AF. (You can get the books mentioned above for free by giving away some personal info)
- [TGI Kubernetes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7bmigfV0EqQzxcNpmcdTJ9eFRPBe-iZa): *TGIK* weekly streams by VMWare. Love *Josh* and *Joe*
