I've been watching a lot of cricket since childhood (as most Indians?). I play it sometimes, even though I don't yet know the super intricate details of the game (where to pitch the ball, how difficult is it to hit a particular shot, (lazy to memorise) Gully vs. Silly point, etc). I used to follow cricbuzz a lot. (There were days when I was happy because Cricbuzz published my comments :blush:) 

Some of my recent pastimes are watching F1, Agadmator chess videos and K-dramas.

I have a habit of getting a musical instrument while not learning to play it. My goal over the next year is to spend time to learn an instrument.

I love playing board games, card games, and poker with friends. (goal is to know more interesting board games by visiting board-game cafes)

I want to go darshini-hopping and eat from as many places from lists like [this](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WUE7nL4BAKFKMNeY8) during my stay in Bangalore.

I enjoy standup comedy. My first ever standup show was watching Atul Khatri perform in the university. After that, I came across East India Comedy (EIC), of which Atul was part of and watched their videos on Youtube (I still remember Ghanta awards). I used to be a big fan of EIC (And also EIC Outrage). I started following the Indian Standup scene on the web in 2017. Some of my favorites are EIC, Biswa, Kenny, (some) AIB, Abish (for Son Of Abish), Niveditha (from TLC Queens Of Comedy), Urooj (Comicstaan), Abhishek Upmanyu, Zakir, Rahul Subramanian, Aravind SA, Prashasti. I personally liked Comicstaan a lot (also The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel series for its standup roots). I wish to watch more live comedy shows.

I believe in the evolution of the Indian Hip Hop scene (similar to the rise of Indian Standup) made famous by the film *Gully Boy* into the mainstream. (I love the whole album too, you can catch me humming *Azadi* and *Jingostan*)

Some recent sitcoms I enjoyed a lot are *Modern Family* and *Malcolm in the Middle*
