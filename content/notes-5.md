- [Finshots](https://finshots.in/): Short and sweet articles once a day, cleanly explained in layman terms, market economics and India centered

- [A Junior VC](https://ajuniorvc.com/): *To update*

- [The Ken](https://the-ken.com/) (vs.?) [The Morning Context](https://themorningcontext.com/): *To update*, Looked like quality content. But behind a paywall. I wouldn't pay ~100 USD each per year, at least at this point.
- [Short Cartooned materials on programming by Julia Evans](https://wizardzines.com/): read some free guides
- *Two Scoops Of Icecream Django*: I tried to read the free version of it. I liked the material but quite a big book (*Come back later*). Loved the fact that the authors were a couple :laughing:
- I learned about Kubernetes, mainly from *Kubernetes Up and Running* and *Managing Kubernetes* books, multiple youtube videos by *CNCF* and *Google Cloud Next*. *Kelsey Hightower* is dope AF. (You can get the books mentioned above for free by giving away some personal info)
- [TGI Kubernetes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7bmigfV0EqQzxcNpmcdTJ9eFRPBe-iZa): *TGIK* weekly streams by VMWare. Love *Josh* and *Joe*
