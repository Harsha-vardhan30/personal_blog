My current workflow for writing a new article: Write up whatever comes to my mind in an editor like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), keep iterating through the material and modify it. Check for any grammar mistakes on [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/), convert it into Markdown, and commit the article.

One thing I believe most tech companies should start doing more often is trying to provide internal services as [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) and commercialize them. It also helps them improve their services, better documentation, and pushes the service to adapt to the community's needs. 

I like [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) for that reason as a marketplace for web APIs. I also like Google cloud [products](https://cloud.google.com/products) for a similar reason; many things like Vision, Speech to Text are available as a service with good SDK support for many programming languages.

[Off facebook activity](https://www.facebook.com/off_facebook_activity/activity_list) tracking: I am quite surprised to see this list. I have no clue how FB has information on all the apps I use and the sites I visit. I wish to understand more about how cookies function cross-site after seeing things like this. Maybe third-parties give my info via shared email. God knows! (I have been tracked by FB on sites where I don't have an account too) Some people might say there's no harm in sharing your data for better personalization. And privacy is a myth, governments and ISPs(?) track you anyways.

I like [this](https://github.com/Yashasvi-Sriram/scv) idea from a friend of mine for maintaining CVs. Just have a short note on each repo for adding content to CVs and pull content from individual repositories.

This site is built on Hugo, a static site generator. SSG's might be great for generating static content on the web. I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting (have also heard of Zeit, now [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)). Both these companies are doing great in terms of business too.

I thought there were *some* similarities between Hugo and Django. (Maybe because both were made with a similar view in mind: generating material for content sites) Django's templating looks similar to Go templating (used by Hugo). And Django uses web templates as a base for rendering content like most SSGs. I like the Django debug logs on browsers much in comparison to Hugo's debugging. (Some better version of [this](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-bare-min-theme) should be shipped by default?)

A small piece of info whenever you see a (capital) Y/n for yes/no, yes is the default, but if you see a y/n, you have to type over what you want to do precisely. I wanted to document this little thing I missed a lot of times: whenever I see a y/n on Linux terminal, I press the enter key by default and try deciphering the error msg why it failed.

Tip: Use SSH keys instead of logging in via password. Use ssh config for managing multiple ssh keys at work. In short, manage config via files: .gitconfig, .kube/config.

An interesting read on [Pypi malicious packages](https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-malicious-python-libraries-removed-from-pypi/). Also, many similar cases with public registries: npm, Dockerhub.

I start reading an article from my search, then read one of you may like items and so on. End up staring at a random piece at the end of 2 hrs.

I recently bought the Buds plus. Felt great on using them. Significant pro: seamless connectivity and battery life. Major con: sucks bad for calls (at least web calls I tried upon). 

My search for a good music app: Youtube Premium - carries my recommendations from youtube. And naturally great suggestions. High cost was a downside for me. I tried using Amazon music, but offline music gets corrupted after some days during offline use.

I wanted a platform to know people's opinions and thoughts. Facebook and Instagram are used mostly for sharing pics, life moments, and memes. So recently, I joined Twitter (better late than never). Initially, I didn't want my feed to be cluttered. Thus I am avoiding celebrities (follow and mute is better maybe?, currently doing this for pages I want to read about once in a while, should try out lists feature to filter-out feed when need be).
